  <p class="text-lg">
    LoRA is a technique used to fine-tune large language models for efficient
    adaptation to specific domains or tasks. It reduces the number of trainable
    parameters, making the adaptation process more efficient and fast. LoRA is
    particularly useful in image models like Stable Diffusion, where it enables
    style specialization and character consistency in image generation.

    In the following example, we can see how using a lora can change the style
    of an image.
